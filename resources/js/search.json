Discovery of the Vulnerability","p":["The vulnerability was discovered by Max Kellermann when investigating a bug report related to the corruption of access logs on a Linux server. Kellermann identified that the root cause was related to how the Linux kernel managed pipes and allowed for incorrect data modification of read-only files."]},{"i":"12-systems-affected","l":"1.2. Systems Affected","p":["Dirty Pipe affects Linux distributions running the vulnerable versions of the kernel, including but not limited to:","Ubuntu","Debian","Fedora","Arch Linux","Any other distribution using affected kernel versions."]},{"l":"2. Technical Details","p":["The Dirty Pipe vulnerability arises from an improper handling of pipe buffers in the Linux kernel, particularly when merging pages from the buffer cache into the pipe buffer. This process lacks adequate validation checks, allowing data to be inserted or altered even in read-only files."]},{"i":"21-how-it-works","l":"2.1. How It Works","p":["Pipe Buffers: Pipes in Linux are temporary data conduits often used for communication between processes. They use memory buffers managed by the kernel.","Page Cache: The kernel uses page cache to improve file access efficiency by storing frequently accessed data in memory. A flaw in the way the kernel merges data from the page cache into the pipe buffer forms the basis of this vulnerability.","Exploit Mechanism:","By carefully crafting inputs into the pipe buffer, an attacker can inject data into read-only files.","This can be done without write permissions because the exploit manipulates the buffer state directly within the kernel.","Specific Flaw:","If a pipe buffer is created with specific conditions, the vulnerability allows writing arbitrary data into a target file.","This happens because of a missing check that allows unprivileged users to map writable pages into the read-only page cache."]},{"l":"3. Exploit Scenario","p":["This section details a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how CVE-2022-0847 can be exploited for privilege escalation."]},{"i":"31-exploitation-requirements","l":"3.1.

Steps of the Exploit","p":["Create a Pipe: The exploit starts by creating a pipe to facilitate communication between two file descriptors.","Splice Data: It splices data from the targeted file (e.g., /etc/passwd) into the pipe. This step manipulates the internal state of the pipe buffer.","Inject Malicious Payload: It then injects crafted payload data into the pipe, which results in unauthorized modification of the file.","Privilege Escalation: Once the /etc/passwd file is modified, the attacker gains unauthorized root access."]},{"l":"4. Impact Analysis","p":["The Dirty Pipe vulnerability's impact is substantial due to the ease with which it can be exploited and the high privilege escalation it provides."]},{"i":"41-security-implications","l":"4.1. Security Implications","p":["Unauthorized Access: Allows an unprivileged user to gain root access.","Data Corruption: Allows the modification of read-only files, which could disrupt critical system operations.","Persistence: Attackers can create backdoors for persistent unauthorized access."]},{"i":"42-potential-targets","l":"4.2.
