The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released in 1977, but since it contained the Unix code owned by AT&T, a resulting lawsuit limited the development of BSD. Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983. His goal was to create a free Unix-like operating system, and part of his work resulted in the GNU General Public License (GPL) being created. Projects by others over the years failed to result in a working, free kernel that would become widely adopted until the creation of the Linux kernel.","At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to create a new, free operating system kernel. Over the years, the Linux kernel has gone from a small number of files written in C under licensing that prohibited commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million source code lines (comments excluded), licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.","Linux is available in over 600 distributions (or an operating system based on the Linux kernel and supporting software and libraries). Some of the most popular and well-known being Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, elementary, Manjaro, Gentoo Linux, RedHat, and Linux Mint.","Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than Windows operating systems and is very frequently updated. Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware drivers as Windows.","Since Linux is free and open-source, the source code can be modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone. Linux-based operating systems run on servers, mainframes, desktops, embedded systems such as routers, televisions, video game consoles, and more. The overall Android operating system that runs on smartphones and tablets is based on the Linux kernel, and because of this, Linux is the most widely installed operating system.","Linux is an operating system like Windows, iOS, Android, or macOS. An OS is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with our computer. That means that an OS manages the whole communication between software and hardware. Also, there exist many different distributions (distro). It is like a version of Windows operating systems.","With the interactive instances, we get access to the Pwnbox, a customized version of Parrot OS.

They are used for various purposes, from servers and embedded devices to desktop computers and mobile phones. Each Linux distribution is different, with its own set of features, packages, and tools. Some popular examples include:","Ubuntu","Fedora","CentOS","Debian","Red Hat Enterprise Linux","Many users choose Linux for their desktop computers because it is free, open source, and highly customizable. Ubuntu and Fedora are two popular choices for desktop Linux and beginners. It is also widely used as a server operating system because it is secure, stable, and reliable and comes with frequent and regular updates. Finally, we, as cybersecurity specialists, often prefer Linux because it is open source, meaning its source code is available for scrutiny and customization. Because of such customization, we can optimize and customize our Linux distribution the way we want and configure it for specific use cases only if necessary.","We can use those distros everywhere, including (web) servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, cloud computing, and desktop computing.

Finally, red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS are popular for enterprise-level computing."]},{"l":"Debian","p":["Debian is a widely used and well-respected Linux distribution known for its stability and reliability. It is used for various purposes, including desktop computing, servers, and embedded system. It uses an Advanced Package Tool ( apt) package management system to handle software updates and security patches. The package management system helps keep the system up-to-date and secure by automatically downloading and installing security updates as soon as they are available. This can be executed manually or set up automatically.","Debian can have a steeper learning curve than other distributions, but it is widely regarded as one of the most flexible and customizable Linux distros. The configuration and setup can be complex, but it also provides excellent control over the system, which can be good for advanced users. The more control we have over a Linux system, the more complex it feels to become. However, it just feels that way compared to the options and possibilities we get. Without learning it with the required depth, we might spend way more time configuring “easy” tasks and processes than when we would learn to use a few commands and tools more in-depth. We will see it in the Filter Contents and Find Files and Directories sections.","Stability and reliability are key strengths of Debian. The distribution is known for its long-term support releases, which can provide updates and security patches for up to five years. This can be especially important for servers and other systems that must be up and running 24/7. It has had some vulnerabilities, but the development community has quickly released patches and security updates. In addition, Debian has a strong commitment to security and privacy, and the distribution has a well-established security track record. Debian is a versatile and reliable Linux distribution that is widely used for a range of purposes. Its stability, reliability, and commitment to security make it an attractive choice for various use cases, including cyber security."]},{"l":"Introduction to Shell","p":["It is crucial to learn how to use the Linux shell, as there are many servers based on Linux. These are often used because Linux is less error-prone as opposed to Windows servers. For example, web servers are often based on Linux. Knowing how to use the operating system to control it effectively requires understanding and mastering Linux’s essential part, the Shell. When we first switched from Windows to Linux, does it look something like this:","![[Pasted image 20240911151339.png]]","A Linux terminal, also called a shell or command line, provides a text-based input/output (I/O) interface between users and the kernel for a computer system. The term console is also typical but does not refer to a window but a screen in text mode. In the terminal window, commands can be executed to control the system.","We can think of a shell as a text-based GUI in which we enter commands to perform actions like navigating to other directories, working with files, and obtaining information from the system but with way more capabilities."]},{"l":"Terminal Emulators","p":["Terminal emulation is software that emulates the function of a terminal. It allows the use of text-based programs within a graphical user interface ( GUI). There are also so-called command-line interfaces ( CLI) that run as additional terminals in one terminal. In short, a terminal serves as an interface to the shell interpreter.","Terminal emulators and multiplexers are beneficial extensions for the terminal. They provide us with different methods and functions to work with the terminal, such as splitting the terminal into one window, working in multiple directories, creating different workspaces, and much more. An example of the use of such a multiplexer called Tmux could look something like this:","![[Pasted image 20240911151353.png]]"]},{"l":"Shell","p":["The most commonly used shell in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell( BASH), and is part of the GNU project. Everything we do through the GUI we can do with the shell. The shell gives us many more possibilities to interact with programs and processes to get information faster.

The prompt is usually displayed on a new line, and the cursor is positioned after the prompt, ready for the user to start typing a command.","It can be customized to provide useful information to the user. The format can look something like this:","The home directory for a user is marked with a tilde <~> and is the default folder when we log in.","The dollar sign, in this case, stands for a user. As soon as we log in as root, the character changes to a hash<#> and looks like this:","For example, when we upload and run a shell on the target system, we may not see the username, hostname, and current working directory.

However, we can look at the bash-prompt-generator and powerline, which gives us the possibility to adapt our prompt to our needs.","In addition to customizing the prompt, we can customize their terminal environment with different color schemes, fonts, and other settings to make their work environment more visually appealing and easier to use.","In addition to providing basic information like the current user and working directory, we can customize to display other information in the prompt, such as the IP address, date, time, the exit status of the last command, and more. This is especially useful for us during our penetration tests because we can use various tools and possibilities like script or the .bash_history to filter and print all the commands we used and sort them by date and time. For example, the prompt could be set to display the full path of the current working directory instead of just the current directory name, which can also include the target’s IP address if we work organized.","Name of the shell","Newline","Number of jobs managed by the shell","Special Character","The prompt can be customized using special characters and variables in the shell’s configuration file (.bashrc for the Bash shell).

Each user can be a member of different groups, and membership in these groups gives the user specific, additional permissions. Each file and directory belongs to a specific user and a specific group. So the permissions for users and groups that defined a file are also defined for the respective owners. When we create new files or directories, they belong to the group we belong to and us.","When a user wants to access the contents of a Linux directory, they must first traverse the directory, which means navigating to that directory, requiring the user to have execute permissions on the directory. Without this permission, the user cannot access the directory's contents and will instead be presented with a “ Permission Denied\" error message.","It is important to note that execute permissions are necessary to traverse a directory, no matter the user's level of access. Also, execute permissions on a directory do not allow a user to execute or modify any files or contents within the directory, only to traverse and access the content of the directory.","To execute files within the directory, a user needs execute permissions on the corresponding file. To modify the contents of a directory (create, delete, or rename files and subdirectories), the user needs write permissions on the directory.","The whole permission system on Linux systems is based on the octal number system, and basically, there are three different types of permissions a file or directory can be assigned:","( r) - Read","( w) - Write","( x) - Execute","The permissions can be set for the owner, group, and others like presented in the next example with their corresponding permissions."]},{"l":"Change Permissions","p":["We can modify permissions using the chmod command, permission group references ( u- owner, g- Group, o- others, a- All users), and either a [+] or a [-] to add remove the designated permissions.

The letter \" s\" is used instead of an \" x\". When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.","It is often the case that administrators are not familiar with the applications but still assign the SUID/SGID bits, which leads to a high-security risk. Such programs may contain functions that allow the execution of a shell from the pager, such as the application \" journalctl.\"","If the administrator sets the SUID bit to \" journalctl,\" any user with access to this application could execute a shell as root.

This type of permission provides an extra layer of security when controlling the deletion and renaming of files within a directory. It is typically used on directories that are shared by multiple users to prevent one user from accidentally deleting or renaming files that are important to others.","For example, in a shared home directory, where multiple users have access to the same directory, a system administrator can set the sticky bit on the directory to ensure that only the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the root user can delete or rename files within the directory. This means that other users cannot delete or rename files within the directory as they do not have the required permissions. This provides an added layer of security to protect important files, as only those with the necessary access can delete or rename files. Setting the sticky bit on a directory ensures that only the owner, the directory owner, or the root user can change the files within the directory.","When a sticky bit is set on a directory, it is represented by the letter “ t\" in the execute permission of the directory's permissions. For example, if a directory has permissions “ rwxrwxrwt\", it means that the sticky bit is set, giving the extra level of security so that no one other than the owner or root user can delete or rename the files or folders in the directory.","Permission Management","In this example, we see that both directories have the sticky bit set. However, the reports folder has an uppercase T, and the scripts folder has a lowercase t.","If the sticky bit is capitalized ( T), then this means that all other users do not have execute( x) permissions and, therefore, cannot see the contents of the folder nor run any programs from it.

The package management software retrieves the necessary changes for system installation from the package itself and then implements these changes to install the package successfully.

The size of the swap space is a matter of personal preference and depends on the amount of physical memory installed in the system and the type of usage the system will be subjected to. When creating a swap space, it is important to ensure that it is placed on a dedicated partition or file, separate from the rest of the file system. This helps to prevent fragmentation of the swap space and ensures that the system has adequate swap space available when it is needed. It is also important to ensure that the swap space is encrypted, as sensitive data may be stored in the swap space temporarily.","In addition to being used as an extension of physical memory, swap space can also be used for hibernation, which is a power management feature that allows the system to save its state to disk and then power off instead of shutting down completely.

Moreover, developing a firm grasp on the intricacies of network interfaces is an essential ability in the modern, interconnected world. With the rapid advancement of technology and the increasing reliance on digital communication, having a comprehensive knowledge of how to work with network interfaces can enable you to navigate the diverse array of networks that exist nowadays effectively.","One way to obtain information regarding network interfaces, such as IP addresses, netmasks, and status, is by using the ifconfig command. By executing this command, we can view the available network interfaces and their respective attributes in a clear and organized manner. This information can be particularly useful when troubleshooting network connectivity issues or setting up a new network configuration. It should be noted that the ifconfig command has been deprecated in newer versions of Linux and replaced by the ip command, which offers more advanced features.

Without proper DNS server configuration, devices may experience network connectivity issues and be unable to access certain online resources. This can be achieved by updating the /etc/resolv.conf file with the appropriate DNS server information. The /etc/resolv.conf file is a plain text file containing the system's DNS information.

As a penetration tester, it is vital to understand the significance of NAC in protecting the network and the various NAC technologies that can be utilized to enhance security measures. NAC is a security system that ensures that only authorized and compliant devices are granted access to the network, preventing unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. By implementing NAC, organizations can be confident in their ability to protect their assets and data from cybercriminals who always seek to exploit system vulnerabilities. The following are the different NAC technologies that can be used to enhance security measures:","Discretionary access control (DAC)","Mandatory access control (MAC)","Role-based access control (RBAC)","These technologies are designed to provide different levels of access control and security.

It is a widely used access control system that enables users to manage access to their resources by granting resource owners the responsibility of controlling access permissions to their resources. This means that users and groups who own a specific resource can decide who has access to their resources and what actions they are authorized to perform. These permissions can be set for reading, writing, executing, or deleting the resource."]},{"l":"Mandatory Access Control","p":["MAC is used in infrastructure that provides more fine-grained control over resource access than DAC systems. Those systems define rules that determine resource access based on the resource's security level and the user's security level or process requesting access. Each resource is assigned a security label that identifies its security level, and each user or process is assigned a security clearance that identifies its security level. Access to a resource is only granted if the user's or process's security level is equal to or greater than the security level of the resource. MAC is often used in operating systems and applications that require a high level of security, such as military or government systems, financial systems, and healthcare systems. MAC systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access to resources and minimize the impact of security breaches."]},{"l":"Role-based Access Control","p":["RBAC assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization. Users are assigned roles based on their job responsibilities or other criteria, and each role is granted a set of permissions that determine the actions they can perform. RBAC simplifies the management of access permissions, reduces the risk of errors, and ensures that users can access only the resources necessary to perform their job functions. It can restrict access to sensitive resources and data, limit the impact of security breaches, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Compared to Discretionary Access Control (DAC) systems, RBAC provides a more flexible and scalable approach to managing resource access. In an RBAC system, each user is assigned one or more roles, and each role is assigned a set of permissions that define the user's actions. Resource access is granted based on the user's assigned role rather than their identity or ownership of the resource. RBAC systems are typically used in environments with many users and resources, such as large organizations, government agencies, and financial institutions."]},{"l":"Monitoring","p":["Network monitoring involves capturing, analyzing, and interpreting network traffic to identify security threats, performance issues, and suspicious behavior. The primary goal of analyzing and monitoring network traffic is identifying security threats and vulnerabilities.

As a result, we will obtain this user’s credentials that might help us to infiltrate the network even further or escalate our privileges to a higher level. In short, by analyzing network traffic, we can gain insights into network behavior and identify patterns that may indicate security threats. Such analysis includes detecting suspicious network activity, identifying malicious traffic, and identifying potential security risks.

There is almost no worse scenario than when a company is compromised due to a penetration test. By implementing these security measures and ensuring that we set up corresponding protection against potential attackers, we can significantly reduce the risk of data leaks and ensure our systems remain secure. While these tools share some similarities, they also have important differences.","SELinux is a MAC system that is built into the Linux kernel. It is designed to provide fine-grained access control over system resources and applications. SELinux works by enforcing a policy that defines the access controls for each process and file on the system.

AppArmor is implemented as a Linux Security Module (LSM) and uses application profiles to define the resources that an application can access. AppArmor is typically easier to use and configure than SELinux but may not provide the same level of fine-grained control.","TCP wrappers are a host-based network access control mechanism that can be used to restrict access to network services based on the IP address of the client system. It works by intercepting incoming network requests and comparing the IP address of the client system to the access control rules. These are useful for limiting access to network services from unauthorized systems.","Regarding similarities, the three security mechanisms share the common goal of ensuring the safety and security of Linux systems. In addition to providing extra protection, they can restrict access to resources and services, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It's also worth noting that these mechanisms are readily available as part of most Linux distributions, making them accessible to us to enhance their systems' security. Furthermore, these mechanisms can be easily customized and configured using standard tools and utilities, making them a convenient choice for Linux users.","In terms of differences, SELinux and AppArmor are both MAC systems that provide fine-grained access control over system resources but work in different ways. SELinux is built into the kernel and is more complex to configure and use, while AppArmor is implemented as a module and is typically easier to use.

The X11 is a fixed system that consists of a collection of protocols and applications that allow us to call application windows on displays in a graphical user interface. X11 is predominant on Unix systems, but X servers are also available for other operating systems. Nowadays, the XServer is a part of almost every desktop installation of Ubuntu and its derivatives and does not need to be installed separately.","When a desktop is started on a Linux computer, the communication of the graphical user interface with the operating system happens via an X server. The computer's internal network is used, even if the computer should not be in a network. The practical thing about the X protocol is network transparency. This protocol mainly uses TCP/IP as a transport base but can also be used on pure Unix sockets. The ports that are utilized for X server are typically located in the range of TCP/6001-6009, allowing communication between the client and server. When starting a new desktop session via X server the TCP port 6000 would be opened for the first X display :0. This range of ports enables the server to perform its tasks such as hosting applications, as well as providing services to clients. They are often used to provide remote access to a system, allowing users to access applications and data from anywhere in the world. Additionally, these ports are also essential for the secure sharing of files and data, making them an integral part of the Open X Server. Thus an X server is not dependent on the local computer, it can be used to access other computers, and other computers can use the local X server. Provided that both local and remote computers contain Unix/Linux systems, additional protocols such as VNC and RDP are superfluous. VNC and RDP generate the graphical output on the remote computer and transport it over the network. Whereas with X11, it is rendered on the local computer. This saves traffic and a load on the remote computer. However, X11's significant disadvantage is the unencrypted data transmission. However, this can be overcome by tunneling the SSH protocol.","For this, we have to allow X11 forwarding in the SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) on the server that provides the application by changing this option to yes."]},{"l":"X11Forwarding","p":["Remote Desktop Protocols in Linux","With this we can start the application from our client with the following command:","image"]},{"l":"X11 Security","p":["X11 is not a secure protocol without suitable security measures since X11 communication is entirely unencrypted.

XDMCP is an insecure protocol and should not be used in any environment that requires high levels of security. With this, it is possible to redirect an entire graphical user interface ( GUI) (such as KDE or Gnome) to a corresponding client. For a Linux system to act as an XDMCP server, an X system with a GUI must be installed and configured on the server. After starting the computer, a graphical interface should be available locally to the user.","One potential way that XDMCP could be exploited is through a man-in-the-middle attack. In this type of attack, an attacker intercepts the communication between the remote computer and the X Window System server, and impersonates one of the parties in order to gain unauthorized access to the server.

For example, if a user needs to run a command as root, then that command should be specified in the sudoers configuration instead of giving them full sudo rights. Another common protection mechanism that can be used is fail2ban. This tool counts the number of failed login attempts, and if a user has reached the maximum number, the host that tried to connect will be handled as configured.","It is also important to periodically audit the system to ensure that issues do not exist that could facilitate privilege escalation, such as an out-of-date kernel, user permission issues, world-writable files, and misconfigured cron jobs, or misconfigured services.

In other words, they can filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined rules, protocols, ports, and other criteria to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate security threats. The specific goal of a firewall implementation can vary depending on the specific needs of the organization, such as ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network resources.","An example from the history of Linux firewalls is the development of the iptables tool, which replaced the earlier ipchains and ipfwadm tools.

However, the syntax of nftables rules is not compatible with iptables, so migration to nftables requires some effort. UFW stands for “Uncomplicated Firewall” and provides a simple and user-friendly interface for configuring firewall rules. UFW is built on top of the iptables framework like nftables and provides an easier way to manage firewall rules. Finally, FirewallD provides a dynamic and flexible firewall solution that can be used to manage complex firewall configurations, and it supports a rich set of rules for filtering network traffic and can be used to create custom firewall zones and services. It consists of several components that work together to provide a flexible and powerful firewall solution. The main components of iptables are:","Component","Description","Tables","Tables are used to organize and categorize firewall rules.","Chains","Chains are used to group a set of firewall rules applied to a specific type of network traffic.","Rules","Rules define the criteria for filtering network traffic and the actions to take for packets that match the criteria.","Matches","Matches are used to match specific criteria for filtering network traffic, such as source or destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more.","Targets","Targets specify the action for packets that match a specific rule. For example, targets can be used to accept, drop, or reject packets or modify the packets in another way."]},{"l":"Tables","p":["When working with firewalls on Linux systems, it is important to understand how tables work in iptables.

The raw table contains two built-in chains: PREROUTING and OUTPUT."]},{"l":"Chains","p":["In iptables, chains organize rules that define how network traffic should be filtered or modified. There are two types of chains in iptables:","Built-in chains","User-defined chains","The built-in chains are pre-defined and automatically created when a table is created. Each table has a different set of built-in chains. For example, the filter table has three built-in chains:","INPUT","OUTPUT","FORWARD","These chains are used to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, as well as traffic that is being forwarded between different network interfaces. The nat table has two built-in chains:","PREROUTING","POSTROUTING","The PREROUTING chain is used to modify the destination IP address of incoming packets before the routing table processes them. The POSTROUTING chain is used to modify the source IP address of outgoing packets after the routing table has processed them. The mangle table has five built-in chains:","These chains are used to modify the header fields of incoming and outgoing packets and packets being processed by the corresponding chains.","User-defined chains can simplify rule management by grouping firewall rules based on specific criteria, such as source IP address, destination port, or protocol. They can be added to any of the three main tables. For example, if an organization has multiple web servers that all require similar firewall rules, the rules for each server could be grouped in a user-defined chain. Another example is when a user-defined chain could filter traffic destined for a specific port, such as port 80 (HTTP). The user could then add rules to this chain that specifically filter traffic destined for port 80."]},{"l":"Rules and Targets","p":["ACCEPT","Adds or modifies the Netfilter mark value of the packet, which can be used for advanced routing or other purposes","Allows the packet to pass through the firewall and continue to its destination","Description","DNAT","DROP","Drops the packet and sends an error message back to the source address, notifying them that the packet was blocked","Drops the packet, effectively blocking it from passing through the firewall","Each rule consists of a set of criteria or matches and a target specifying the action for packets that match the criteria. The criteria or matches match specific fields in the IP header, such as the source or destination IP address, protocol, source, destination port number, and more. The target specifies the action for packets that match the criteria. They specify the action to take for packets that match a specific rule. For example, targets can accept, drop, reject, or modify the packets. Some of the common targets used in iptables rules include the following:","Firewall Setup","Iptables rules are used to define the criteria for filtering network traffic and the actions to take for packets that match the criteria.

These logs are important for monitoring and troubleshooting the system, as they can provide insights into system behavior, application activity, and security events. These system logs can be a valuable source of information for identifying potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities within a Linux system as well. By analyzing the logs on our target systems, we can gain insights into the system's behavior, network activity, and user activity and can use this information to identify any abnormal activity, such as unauthorized logins, attempted attacks, clear text credentials, or unusual file access, which could indicate a potential security breach.","We, as penetration testers, can also use system logs to monitor the effectiveness of our security testing activities. By reviewing the logs after performing security testing, we can determine if our activities triggered any security events, such as intrusion detection alerts or system warnings. This information can help us refine our testing strategies and improve the overall security of the system.","In order to ensure the security of a Linux system, it is important to configure system logs properly. This includes setting the appropriate log levels, configuring log rotation to prevent log files from becoming too large, and ensuring that the logs are stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.

They are often stored in their own files, such as /var/log/apache2/error.log for the Apache web server or /var/log/mysql/error.log for the MySQL database server. These logs are particularly important when we are targeting specific applications, such as web servers or databases, as they can provide insights into how these applications are processing and handling data. By examining these logs, we can identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. For example, access logs can be used to track requests made to a web server, while audit logs can be used to track changes made to the system or to specific files. These logs can be used to identify unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration, or other suspicious activity.","Besides, access and audit logs are critical logs that record information about the actions of users and processes on the system.

Firstly, Solaris is a proprietary operating system owned and developed by Oracle Corporation, and its source code is not available to the general public. In contrast, most Linux distributions are open-source, meaning that their source code is available for anyone to modify and use. Additionally, Linux distributions commonly use the Zettabyte File System ( ZFS), which is a highly advanced file system that offers features such as data compression, snapshots, and high scalability. On the other hand, Solaris uses a Service Management Facility ( SMF), which is a highly advanced service management framework that provides better reliability and availability for system services.","Solaris has a number of unique features that set it apart from other operating systems.

In Solaris, the NFS server can be configured using the share command, which is used to share a directory over the network, and it also allows us to specify various options such as read/write permissions, access restrictions, and more. To share a directory over NFS in Solaris, we can use the following command:","Solaris","This command shares the /export/home directory with read and writes permissions over NFS. An NFS client can mount the NFS file system using the mount command, the same way as with Ubuntu. To mount an NFS file system in Solaris, we need to specify the server name and the path to the shared directory. For example, to mount an NFS share from a server with the IP address 10.129.15.122 and the shared directory /nfs_share, we use the following command:","In Solaris, the configuration for NFS is stored in the /etc/dfs/dfstab file.
